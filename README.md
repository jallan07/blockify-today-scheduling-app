# Work Day Scheduler

In this project, I created a simple work day calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app runs in the browser, and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

## Resources Used

- Moment.js
- Bootstrap
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- jQuery

## User Story

```
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

## Project Criteria

```
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours

THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event

```
